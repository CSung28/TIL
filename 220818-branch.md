# .gitignore


## What is .gitignore? 
- .gitignore is used when git tracks the file, write that code becu it makes git won't trace any files or folders, if there is a list in .gitignore, git will ignore the adjustment when it happens. 


- If there are patterns in file name or if there is the certain file name extension to ignore, it can ignore all files in certain directory.


- You can easily make the .gitignore codes that you want(i.g. python, macOS, Windows etc...) at "gitignore.io"


## How to apply .gitignore on the terminal?
- First, you have to make a file with "$ touch .gitingore". Then, you write the code(ls)  to check it, you won't find it. That's becuz it is hidden. So, you have to type "$ ls -a". Then, you can find the .gitignore file.


- next, you make a random files like these.
"$ touch main.c", "$ touch client.py", "$ mkdir crdentials", "touch credntials/precious.py"


- And then, you write the .gitignore code with "$ vi .gitignore".
If you open the file, you have to copy and paste the codes from the "gitignore.io" and close with save.


- After those processes, you have to add and commit the .gitignore.
AND PUSH IT! then you can check it on Github
